This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website.
I plan for this website to be designed to serve as both a portfolio 
and a personal website to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background.
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is currently in development, 
with updates being released each time substantial implementation and testing is completed.
